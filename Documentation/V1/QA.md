## Quality Assurance Framework, Automated Testing Protocols & Verification Strategy

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Quality Philosophy

Quality Assurance (QA) is a core engineering function responsible for ensuring that every software deliverable meets defined functional, security, performance, and usability standards before reaching the client.

The company's QA framework combines automated testing, manual verification, security validation, accessibility checks, and client acceptance testing to minimize production defects and maintain consistent engineering quality.

The primary objectives of this framework are to:

- Deliver reliable software
- Prevent production defects
- Maintain security standards
- Improve developer productivity
- Increase client confidence
- Support continuous integration and deployment

All production releases must successfully pass the quality gates defined in this document.

## 2. QA Strategy & Testing Pyramid

The engineering team follows a layered testing strategy that detects issues as early as possible during development.

```text
                 End-to-End Testing
              (Playwright / Manual QA)

          Integration & API Testing

            Unit & Component Testing

      Static Analysis, Linting & Formatting
```

Every software release should progressively pass each layer before deployment.

## 5. Defect Severity Matrix

| Priority                 | Description                                                    | Target Resolution | Release Impact            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **P1 – Blocker**         | System crash, security issue, payment failure, data corruption | < 4 Hours         | Release Blocked           |
| **P2 – Critical**        | Major feature unavailable                                      | < 24 Hours        | Staging Blocked           |
| **P3 – Major**           | Partial functionality broken                                   | < 48 Hours        | May Proceed with Approval |
| **P4 – Minor**           | Cosmetic issue or typo                                         | < 72 Hours        | Non-blocking              |
