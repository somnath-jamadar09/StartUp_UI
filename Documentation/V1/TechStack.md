## Approved Technology Stack, Infrastructure Architecture & Tooling Standards

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Selection Philosophy

To ensure reliability, maintainability, scalability, and rapid software delivery, the organization follows a standardized technology stack across all internal systems and client projects.

Technology selection is guided by four core principles:

- **Developer Productivity** — Mature frameworks with strong ecosystems and long-term support.
- **Type Safety & Reliability** — Strongly typed development to reduce runtime defects.
- **Cloud-Native Architecture** — Containerized, platform-agnostic services deployable across multiple cloud providers.
- **AI & MLOps Readiness** — Native support for modern artificial intelligence and machine learning workflows.

Every production system should adhere to the technologies and standards defined in this document unless formally approved otherwise.
