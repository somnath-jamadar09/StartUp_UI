| `feature/*`   | Feature Development       | Developers      | Pull Request           |
| `hotfix/*`    | Critical Production Fixes | Restricted      | Emergency Approval     |

---

### Git Workflow

```text
feature/*
      │
      ▼
Pull Request
      │
      ▼
Code Review
      │
      ▼
Automated Tests
      │
      ▼
staging
      │
      ▼
QA Approval
      │
      ▼
main
```

---

### 3.2 Commit Message Standards

The project follows the **Conventional Commits Specification**.

#### Types

```text
feat:

fix:

docs:

style:

refactor:

test:

chore:
```

#### Examples

```text
feat(auth): implement JWT refresh tokens

fix(invoice): correct GST rounding

test(auth): add login integration tests

chore(deps): upgrade express
```

---

### 3.3 Pull Request Policy
