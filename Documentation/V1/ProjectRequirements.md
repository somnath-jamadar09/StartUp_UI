## Project Intake, Technical Feasibility & Requirement Standards

---

## 1. Overview & Document Purpose

This document establishes the **functional**, **non-functional**, **technical**, and **legal** standards governing every project undertaken by the organization.

It serves as the primary reference for:

- Project intake
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Scope definition
- Delivery boundaries
- Quality assurance
- Legal compliance
- Client acceptance criteria

Every engagement—whether for **students**, **academic researchers**, **startups**, or **small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs)**—must satisfy the requirements defined in this document before any quotation, contract, or Statement of Work (SOW) is issued.

---

## 2. Project Classification & Scope Boundaries

Projects are categorized into four service tiers based on technical complexity, engineering effort, expected deliverables, and project duration.
