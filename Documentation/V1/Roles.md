## 7. Delegation & Contingency Protocols

### Engineering Capacity

If engineering workload exceeds available capacity:

- Om reallocates technical tasks.
- Sprint priorities are reassessed.
- Non-critical work is deferred.

---

### Operations Continuity

If Divya is unavailable:

- Om assumes responsibility for:
  - Client communication
  - Quotation approval
  - Payment acknowledgement
  - Operational escalations

Target response time remains **within 24 hours**.

---

### Production Release Authorization

Production deployment requires:

1. QA Approval (Falguni)
2. Technical Approval (Somnath or Om)
3. Final Architecture Sign-Off (Om)

No production deployment may occur without satisfying all three conditions.

---

## 8. Organizational Principles

Every member of the organization follows these operating principles:

- Accountability over ownership.
- Documentation-first culture.
- Security by default.
- Client-first communication.
- Transparent project management.
- Architecture before implementation.
- Quality before delivery.
- Legal and ethical compliance.
- Continuous improvement.
- Collaborative decision-making.
